## About the game

The objective of the game is to reach the water while dodging any the bugs. The bugs will vary in speed as the traverse across the screen.
If the player gets hit by a bug the game will reset.

## Game instructions

* Use arrow keys "up", "down", "left", and "right" to move.

## Winning the game
* Right now once the player reaches the water, the player has won the game and the game will reset.
* I'm hoping that in future updates I can create an outcome that is more exciting.
